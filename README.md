Multiple Disease Risk Prediction Engine is a ML system that forecasts a variety of illnesses such as diabetes, Parkinson's, breast cancer, and liver and heart disease. Enormous amounts of data for each disease is individually visualized, analyzed, cleaned, trained and tested to obtain a highly accurate prediction system using Python and Machine learning algorithms. Numerous algorithms such as Logistic regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision tree, Random forest, and SVM. I also applied Statistical Visualization and evaluated linearity of the data for optimal algorithm and parameter selection. At the end, I deployed this system as a web application using Python and Streamlit.
